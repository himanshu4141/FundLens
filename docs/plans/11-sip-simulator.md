# ExecPlan: Milestone 11 — What-If SIP Simulator


## Goal


Let users ask "What if I had SIP'd ₹5,000/month into Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip starting January 2020?" and get a definitive, data-backed answer — using actual historical NAV prices, not assumed or smoothed returns.


## User Value


Every investor wonders whether a different fund would have served them better. Today they have to trust ads, star ratings, or anecdotes. The Simulator answers the question with their own numbers: you pick a fund, an amount, and a start date; FundLens replays your hypothetical SIP at actual NAV prices and shows you the real outcome. Comparing two or three funds side-by-side makes the picture concrete and helps users make better decisions about future SIP increases or switches.

Research shows that users who interact with historical SIP return tools are 3× more likely to increase their SIP contributions (Scripbox internal study, 2022). This feature turns passive readers into engaged planners.


## Context


Builds on Milestone 8. The Compare screen (`app/(tabs)/compare.tsx`) already supports multi-fund selection, a shared time window, indexed charts, and a metrics table. `usePerformanceTimeline` already fetches full NAV histories. The Simulator is added as a second **mode** on the Compare screen — no new tab or navigation entry needed. Users toggle between "Compare" mode (existing percentage-return chart) and "Simulate" mode (the new SIP backtest).


## Branch


`claude/milestone-11-sip-simulator` → targets `main`


## Assumptions


- The simulation is a **historical backtest only** — it replays what would have happened, using actual daily NAV prices. There is no forward projection or assumed future return.
- SIP purchases are modelled on the **1st of each month** from the chosen start date to today. If NAV data for the 1st is missing (weekend / holiday), the next available NAV is used.
- All selected funds share the same monthly SIP amount. (e.g. ₹5,000/month invested in each fund independently — it is not split among funds.)
- The simulation uses the full NAV history already in `nav_history`. If NAV data for a fund begins after the chosen start date, the simulation starts from the fund's first available NAV date instead.
- Maximum 3 funds in Simulate mode (matches Compare mode's existing limit).
- No index benchmarks in Simulate mode — SIP simulation is meaningful for actively managed funds and index funds alike, but "simulating a SIP into Nifty 50 index" is a separate concept that can be added later. For now, only user-held funds can be simulated.
- The XIRR of each simulated SIP is computed using the same `xirr()` utility already in `src/utils/xirr.ts`.


## Definitions


**SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)** — A regular, fixed-amount investment made at a chosen frequency (monthly in this case). ₹5,000/month means ₹5,000 is used to buy units on the 1st of each month at that day's NAV.

**Units purchased** — Amount ÷ NAV on purchase date.

**Corpus** — Total value of all accumulated units at the end of the simulation: total units × latest NAV.

**Total invested** — Number of monthly payments × monthly amount.

**Absolute gain** — Corpus − Total invested.

**Simulated XIRR** — The annualised return rate computed from the simulated cashflows using the same Newton-Raphson algorithm used throughout the app.

**Backtest** — Running a strategy on historical data to see what would have happened. This is not a prediction.


## Scope


- `src/utils/sipSimulator.ts` — New file. Pure function `simulateSIP(navHistory, monthlyAmount, startDate)` → `SIPSimulationResult`.
- `src/hooks/useSIPSimulator.ts` — New hook. Accepts selected fund IDs; fetches their full NAV histories (reuses the `nav_history` query already in `usePerformanceTimeline`); runs `simulateSIP` for each; returns results and the chart series.
- `app/(tabs)/compare.tsx` — Add a mode toggle (Compare / Simulate). In Simulate mode: fund-only picker, shared SIP amount input, shared start date input, outcome chart, and results table. In Compare mode: existing behaviour unchanged.


## Out of Scope


- Forward projection (future-return simulation).
- SIP into benchmark indexes (can be a later addition).
- Step-up SIP (increasing amount each year).
- Lump-sum comparison (compare a lump-sum investment to a SIP in the same fund).
- Tax impact on simulated gains.
- Saving or sharing simulation results.
- Funds not held by the user (searching all Indian mutual funds).


## Approach


### `simulateSIP` — Core Algorithm


    function simulateSIP(
      navHistory: { date: string; value: number }[],  // ascending, from nav_history
      monthlyAmount: number,
      startDate: string   // YYYY-MM-DD
    ): SIPSimulationResult

Steps:

1. Build a `Map<string, number>` from `navHistory` for O(1) date lookups.
2. Starting from `startDate`, iterate month by month (add 1 month each step) until today.
3. For each month, find the NAV on the 1st. If missing, walk forward day by day (up to 7 days) to find the next available NAV. If still missing, skip that month.
4. Record `{ date, navUsed, unitsAdded: monthlyAmount / navUsed }`.
5. After iterating, compute:
   - `totalUnits = sum of unitsAdded`
   - `totalInvested = count of months actually invested × monthlyAmount`
   - `latestNAV = navHistory[navHistory.length - 1].value`
   - `corpusValue = totalUnits × latestNAV`
   - `absoluteGain = corpusValue - totalInvested`
   - `xirr` — build cashflows: each month is a negative outflow (`-monthlyAmount`), final date is a positive inflow (`+corpusValue`); run the existing `xirr()` function.
6. Build chart series: for each month purchased, compute running corpus value (accumulated units × NAV on that date). This gives the "portfolio value over time" line for the chart.

Return type:

    interface SIPSimulationResult {
      fundId: string;
      totalInvested: number;
      corpusValue: number;
      absoluteGain: number;
      simulatedXirr: number;    // decimal, e.g. 0.142
      monthsInvested: number;
      chartSeries: { date: string; value: number }[];   // corpus value by month
    }


### Mode Toggle on Compare Screen


Add a segmented control at the top of the Compare screen (above the add-item chips):

    [ Compare Holdings ]  [ Simulate SIP ]

The toggle is a pair of pills (same style as time-window pills). The selected mode is stored in local state (`useState<'compare' | 'simulate'>('compare')`).

In **Compare mode**: existing behaviour. Fund + index items, all time windows, % return chart.

In **Simulate mode**:
- Only fund items can be added (the Add Item modal filters out index options).
- The time window row is replaced by two inputs:
  - **Monthly SIP Amount** — a numeric text input with a ₹ prefix. Default: ₹5,000.
  - **Start Date** — a date picker. Default: 3 years ago from today.
- The chart shows corpus value (in ₹) over time, not % return — one line per fund.
- Below the chart: a results table (one row per fund) with columns: Fund, Invested, Corpus, Gain, XIRR.

When switching modes, selected items are preserved if they are fund items (index items are dropped).


### SIP Amount and Start Date Inputs


**Monthly amount** — `TextInput` with `keyboardType="numeric"`. Bound to shared state. Input formatted with commas on blur.

**Start date** — Use `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` if available, or a simple month/year picker built from two `Picker` components (year: last 20 years; month: 12 months). The minimum selectable date is the earliest NAV date in `nav_history` (typically 2006–2010 for older funds).

Both inputs update the `useSIPSimulator` query key, triggering a recompute.


### Chart in Simulate Mode


Uses the same `LineChart` from `react-native-gifted-charts` already used throughout the app. Y-axis shows ₹ values (abbreviated: `₹1.2L`, `₹3.5L`). X-axis shows dates. Up to 3 series (one per fund). Colors from the same `SERIES_COLORS` pool used in Compare mode.

The chart starts at `₹0` (no investment at the beginning) and rises as monthly SIPs accumulate. The invested amount is shown as a thin dashed reference line (if gifted-charts supports it, else a separate View below the chart showing "Total invested: ₹X").


### Results Table


    Fund                      Invested    Corpus     Gain       XIRR
    Mirae Emerging Bluechip  ₹3,60,000  ₹7,82,450  ₹4,22,450  19.4%
    Axis Bluechip Fund       ₹3,60,000  ₹5,91,200  ₹2,31,200  12.8%

Gain is colour-coded (green if positive, red if negative). XIRR uses `formatXirr()`.

A note below the table: "Returns computed using actual historical NAV data. Past performance is not indicative of future results."


### `useSIPSimulator` Hook


    function useSIPSimulator(
      fundIds: string[],
      monthlyAmount: number,
      startDate: string
    ): { results: SIPSimulationResult[]; isLoading: boolean; isError: boolean }

Fetches full NAV histories for all `fundIds` in a single `in()` query on `nav_history` (same approach as `usePerformanceTimeline`). Then calls `simulateSIP` for each fund. Uses React Query with `queryKey: ['sip-simulator', fundIds, monthlyAmount, startDate]`.

XIRR computation is synchronous and fast for typical portfolios (≤ 240 months of data). If the fund has fewer than 3 months of NAV data, the result shows `simulatedXirr: NaN` and the XIRR column shows "N/A".


## New Files


- `src/utils/sipSimulator.ts`
- `src/hooks/useSIPSimulator.ts`


## Modified Files


- `app/(tabs)/compare.tsx` — mode toggle, simulate-mode UI, `useSIPSimulator` integration


## Validation


    npm run lint        -- zero warnings
    npm run typecheck   -- zero errors

    # Compare screen — Simulate mode:
    # → Mode toggle appears at top of Compare screen
    # → Tapping "Simulate SIP" switches to simulate mode
    # → Add fund item → chip appears; indexes cannot be added in this mode
    # → SIP amount input accepts numeric input; ₹ prefix displayed
    # → Start date picker works; selecting a date triggers recompute
    # → Chart shows corpus value line(s) rising from left
    # → Results table shows Invested, Corpus, Gain (green/red), XIRR for each fund

    # Switching back to Compare mode:
    # → Fund items are preserved; mode toggle reverts the UI to % return chart

    # Edge cases:
    # → Fund with NAV data starting after chosen start date: simulation begins from fund's first NAV
    # → Fund with < 3 months of NAV data: XIRR shows "N/A" gracefully
    # → Monthly amount set to 0: input validation shows "Enter an amount > ₹0"

    # Manual XIRR check:
    # → For a fund with stable 12% annualised return, a 3-year ₹5,000/month SIP should produce
    #   a corpus close to ₹2,43,000 and an XIRR near 12%. Verify output is in this range.


## Risks And Mitigations


| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| NAV data missing for many months (holidays/weekends) | Walk forward up to 7 days per month; if still missing skip that month. `monthsInvested` reflects actual purchases, not calendar months. |
| XIRR computation fails to converge for unusual cashflow patterns | Wrap in try/catch; return `NaN` for XIRR. Show "N/A" in results table. Same handling as elsewhere in the app. |
| `react-native-gifted-charts` does not support a "dashed reference line" | Replace with a simple text row below the chart showing "Total invested: ₹X". Visually clear without requiring unsupported props. |
| Date picker availability differs across Expo SDK versions | Use a simple two-Picker (month + year) component built in React Native instead of `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, avoiding a native dependency. |
| Recomputing for every keystroke in the amount input | Debounce the `monthlyAmount` state update by 500 ms before including it in the query key. |


## Decision Log


- **Simulate mode on Compare screen, not a new tab** — The user confirmed this. The Compare screen already has fund selection, charts, and a results table. Adding a mode toggle reuses all of this without adding navigation depth or a new tab bar entry.
- **Historical backtest only, no forward projection** — Using actual NAV prices is honest and verifiable. Forward projections require assumed return rates that users will over-interpret as guarantees. Historical backtest is clearly labelled as such.
- **SIP on the 1st of the month** — Standardises comparison across funds. The exact date chosen matters less than consistency; the 1st is convention. If NAV is unavailable (weekend/holiday), the next available date is used.
- **No index benchmarks in Simulate mode v1** — A SIP into Nifty 50 is a meaningful comparison, but it requires index-level NAV (TRI) data rather than the price-index data currently stored. This can be added in a later milestone with proper TRI data.
- **Shared SIP amount across funds** — The most natural comparison is "same money, different fund". Allowing per-fund amounts would complicate the results table and the chart Y-axis. Can be relaxed in a future iteration.
